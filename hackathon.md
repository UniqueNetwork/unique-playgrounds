# Hackathon

To get started, we recommend you to use the Unique Playgrounds.
Unique Playgrounds is a set of helper classes and functions written in JavaScript to deliver you from as much boilerplate as possible. Also, it contains examples of nesting usage. You can clone the [repository (branch angelhack-polkadot-2022)](https://github.com/UniqueNetwork/unique-playgrounds/tree/angelhack-polkadot-2022) and play with it.


### Nesting description
See [nesting description](https://github.com/UniqueNetwork/unique-playgrounds/blob/angelhack-polkadot-2022/nesting.md) inside the Playgrounds repo.

### Account creation
You should create a Substrate account to deploy your solution.
You can use the [PolkadotJS extension](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/) to create a new account.

To get some tokens to your account, please use [our Telegram bot](https://t.me/unique2faucet_rc_bot).
The bot will ask you for the address of your account and will give 3000 OPL to your account.

An example of a conversation with the bot:
```console
You: /start
[Bot]: Hi <username>!
       Please enter your wallet address to get some OPL.
You: <address>
[Bot]: Just a moment, I'm executing the transaction...
[Bot]: The wallet <address> balance has successfully increased by 3000 OPL
```
